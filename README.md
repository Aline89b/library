![Look for fantasy book in library API](assets/img/javascript-library.png)

This is my second javascript project for s2i platform.
Typing in the search bar the book's title or author it is possible to check if it is present in the list of fantasy books got from [Open library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). Then, clicking on the result appears a modal where you can read the plot of the book then click x button to close it and maybe make a new search.
